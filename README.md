# Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Analysis – End-to-End Analytics & Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project analyzes customer churn for a telecommunications company to identify churn drivers, quantify revenue at risk, and provide actionable retention insights. It was built as a **portfolio-ready, end-to-end data analytics project**, covering data cleaning in Python, KPI analysis in SQL, and interactive visualization in Tableau.

The goal is to demonstrate practical, real-world analytics skills aligned with junior to mid-level data analyst roles.

---

## Business Questions

The analysis answers the following key business questions:

* What is the overall customer churn rate?
* Which customer segments are most likely to churn based on tenure?
* How does contract type affect churn behavior?
* Are high-value customers more likely to churn than regular customers?
* How does the number of subscribed services impact churn likelihood?
* How much monthly revenue is at risk due to churn?
* What are the most common stated reasons for customer churn?

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer-level data from a telecommunications company. Each row represents a single customer and includes:

* Demographics (gender, senior citizen, location)
* Account details (tenure, contract type, payment method)
* Services subscribed (internet, streaming, security, support)
* Financial metrics (monthly charges, total charges, CLTV)
* Churn indicators (churn flag, churn score, churn reason)

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)** – Data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling
* **MySQL** – Data storage, KPI calculations, and SQL views
* **Tableau** – Interactive dashboard and data visualization
* **GitHub** – Version control and documentation

---

## Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Python)

Key preprocessing steps included:

* Handling missing values, especially in churn-related fields
* Standardizing column names (lowercase, underscores) for SQL compatibility
* Ensuring correct data types for numeric and categorical columns

### Engineered Features

* **Tenure Groups**: 0–12, 13–24, 25–48, 49+ months
* **Number of Services**: Total subscribed services per customer
* **High-Value Customer Flag**: Identifies customers with above-average value

These features enable meaningful customer segmentation and deeper churn analysis.

---

## SQL Analysis

Cleaned data was imported into MySQL using `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`.

SQL views were created to support Tableau visualization and ensure consistent business logic:

* Overall churn rate
* Churn by tenure group
* Churn by contract type
* Churn by high-value customer status
* Monthly revenue at risk
* Churn by number of services
* Top churn reasons

## Tableau Dashboard

An interactive Tableau dashboard presents insights using a top-down analytical structure:

Dashboard → ![Customer Churn Dashboard](assets/telco_churn_dash.png)

The dashboard is designed to be clear, minimal, and business-friendly, with filters for contract type, tenure group, and customer value.

---

## Key Insights

* Overall churn rate is approximately **26.5%**
* Customers with **0–12 months tenure** have the highest churn
* **Month-to-month contracts** churn significantly more than long-term contracts
* **High-value customers** show elevated churn risk, increasing revenue exposure
* Customers with fewer subscribed services are more likely to churn
* Pricing, competitive offers, and service quality are the most common churn reasons

---

## Business Recommendations

* Strengthen onboarding and early engagement for new customers
* Encourage long-term contracts through incentives
* Prioritize retention strategies for high-value customers
* Promote service bundling to increase customer stickiness
* Address pricing and service quality issues highlighted by churn reasons

---

## Project Outcome

This project demonstrates a complete analytics and introductory machine learning workflow—from raw data preparation to business recommendations—using tools commonly required in data analytics roles. It reflects real-world challenges such as data cleaning decisions, SQL constraints, KPI design, and dashboard storytelling.
